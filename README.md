# Prototype-Task
Prototype of a game with functional clothes shop including purchasing, selling and equipping the purchased items.

Added in Documentation explaining how the system works, my thought process and my opinion on the overall outcome of the Task. 
Added compressed file containing the executable file for the working Prototype. 

Overall, the given Task was pretty fun, definitely open-ended but gave room for implementing the way I looked at the task. 
Could have undoubtedly polished each aspect in a better way or implemented system in a completely different manner but regardless, 
the outcome is acceptable for me.

Thanks for the opportunity, despite how the result turns out, I hope the best for the future of Little Sim World!
